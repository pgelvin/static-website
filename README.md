# Build a Static Webpage
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to build a static webpage using github pages and plotly.
My example can be found here:
https://pgelvin.github.io/static-website/

You can view this repo as a static web page here: https://plotly-dash-apps.github.io/101-static-website-example/
The notebook create-html-plots.ipynb can be used to produce the html files located in the /docs folder.
Note: 

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub.
Read the following blog post about how to set up your own static webpage.
